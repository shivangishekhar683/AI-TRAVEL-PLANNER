# AI-TRAVEL-PLANNER
This project uses Generative AI to create personalized travel itineraries. I used Gemini as the language model through LangChain, and Gradio for the user interface. The user enters destination, number of days, budget, and travel type. The AI then generates a day-wise travel plan with activities and suggestions.
